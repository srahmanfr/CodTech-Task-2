Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a tool that scans networks or websites for common security vulnerabilities. It aims to identify issues such as open ports, outdated software versions, and misconfigurations to improve system security by providing actionable insights.

Key Features
1.Port Scanning:
Scans specified or common ports to detect open ones.
Identifies potential services running on these ports.

2.Software Version Detection:
Extracts server software details from HTTP headers.
Flags outdated versions or known vulnerable software.

3.Misconfiguration Checks:
Identifies common misconfigurations like default open ports or weak credentials.
Detects unsecured protocols or directory listings.

4.Customizable Scans:
Allows users to specify target IPs, port ranges, and scanning options.
Offers flexibility for different use cases.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python

Libraries/Modules:
socket: For network communications and port scanning.
requests: For interacting with HTTP servers and retrieving headers.
Development Environment: Vscode 

Use Case
The tool can be applied in scenarios such as:
Securing web applications by identifying open ports and server software issues.
Auditing internal networks to ensure misconfigurations are mitigated.
Teaching ethical hacking and cybersecurity fundamentals in educational setups.
Potential Enhancements
Incorporate a vulnerability database (e.g., CVE) to flag risks associated with detected software versions.
Add brute-force testing for common credentials.
Generate detailed reports in JSON, CSV, or HTML formats.
Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction.
This project is designed to improve security awareness and reduce vulnerabilities in networks and web applications, promoting better cybersecurity practices.
